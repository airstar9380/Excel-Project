I was able to gain insights into the dataset by cleaning the data, removing duplicates for my dataset not to be bias, I make use of Pivot table to get the average income per bike buyer purchased, counts of the bike purchased by country, and who purchased more, either male or female. 
I make use of charts for the visualization of my insights, and also create a dashboard.
